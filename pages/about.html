        Hi! My name is Katherine and I use she/her pronouns. My preferred name is Kat. I'm currently pivoting from the
        civil engineering field into software development. My hobbies include taking care of my houseplants, mountain
        biking, and cooking. One interesting fact about me is that I met my husband in Spain on a study abroad trip when
        we were teenagers.<br><br>

        I take pride in my ability to tackle highly technical or ambigious endeavors with ease, even with limited previous
        experience. Paired with my detail oriented mindset, I am able
        to draw connections and understand underlying principals to make consistent forward progress toward my goals. I
        value leadership opportunities where I can share knowledge and train others to do the same. <br><Br>

        I previously specialized in riverine and storm drainage hydrology and hydraulics as a water resourses project
        manager to support flood risk awareness and mitigation. I received my BS in Civil Engineering from Texas Tech
        University in 2014 and received my professional engineering license in the states of Texas and Colorado
        in 2018 and 2019, respectively. I look forward to applying the skills I've learned as an engineer, and my
        enjoyment of problem solving, into my future career as a software developer.
